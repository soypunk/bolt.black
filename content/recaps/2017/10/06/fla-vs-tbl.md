Vasilevskiy was outstanding in a 33 save effort, including stopping around 10 high quality net-front chances. Tampa's defenseman looked above average but the forwards did not forecheck or backcheck well at all. Brayden Point not only showed up on the score sheet with a 1 goal, 2 assist line but won some key faceoffs and was drove his line effectively.
