The score says otherwise but Vasilevskiy was once again outstanding stopping 43 shots. Somehow the Lightning led after the 1st period but they never looked in control of this game. The difference between this game and the previous nights was probably the decline in shot blocking and the quality of the team defensively. The night before the d-core held their own but they seem worn down before this game had started.
