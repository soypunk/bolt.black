Mikhail Sergachev's game winner will get a lot of media attention but I think the buried story will be Peter Budaj's mid-season form in the first two periods and Erne's strong play all night including his second goal of the preseason.

A small shoutout to long time Carolina Hurricane's player Erik Cole, who announced his retirement earlier in the evening.
