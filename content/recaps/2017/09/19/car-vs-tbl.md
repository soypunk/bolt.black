A boys-against-men type lineup as Carolina dressed what looked more like an opening night roster while Tampa played quite a few prospects who most certainly aren't going to make the regular season team this year.

Adam Erne scored the loan Tampa Bay goal on the powerplay in the second period. [Raw Charge's recap gave high marks to Erne's play tonight][1]. Alexander Volkov had not one, but two goals called back.

Tampa Coach John Cooper said:

> "There's 30 minutes of special teams. I don't think that's what's intended."

Preseason is always wonky with the penalties as the league tries to set the standard for the season to come.
