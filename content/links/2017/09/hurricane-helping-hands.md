From the Tampa Bay Lightning organization:

> Martin St. Louis, Vincent Lecavalier, Brad Richards and Dave Andreychuk's families all donated $10,000 to the Hurricane Relief Fund. 

2004 Bolts captain Tim Taylor's immortalized words, "we'll walk together forever", ring even truer with actions like this.
