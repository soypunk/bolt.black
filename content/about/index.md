Bolt Black is written and produced by Shawn Medero from Claremont,&nbsp;California.  He was born and raised in Tampa and was a Tampa Bay Lightning season ticket holder for many seasons before life relocated him across the country. Shawn has followed the Lightning since the team was announced. He *actually* was in the building [the night Alexander Selivanov scored in overtime][1] to deliver a Game 3 playoff victory over the Philadelphia Flyers.

He's currently raising three very excited hockey fans.
